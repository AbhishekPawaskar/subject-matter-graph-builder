    "data": "Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides on-demand, scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web\n\t\tServices (AWS) Cloud. Using Amazon EC2 reduces hardware costs so you can develop and deploy\n\t\tapplications faster. You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you\n\t\tneed, configure security and networking, and manage storage. You can add capacity (scale up)\n\t\tto handle compute-heavy tasks, such as monthly or yearly processes, or spikes in website\n\t\ttraffic. When usage decreases, you can reduce capacity (scale down) again.\nThe following diagram shows a basic architecture of an Amazon EC2 instance deployed within an\n\t\tAmazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). In this example, the EC2 instance is within an Availability Zone in the\n\t\tRegion. The EC2 instance is secured with a security group, which is a virtual firewall that\n\t\tcontrols incoming and outgoing traffic. A private key is stored on the local computer and a\n\t\tpublic key is stored on the instance. Both keys are specified as a key pair to prove the\n\t\tidentity of the user. In this scenario, the instance is backed by an Amazon EBS volume. The VPC\n\t\tcommunicates with the internet using an internet gateway. For more information about Amazon VPC,\n\t\tsee the Amazon VPC User Guide.\nThis user guide provides information specific to running Linux-based instances on\n\t\t\tAmazon EC2. See the EC2 User Guide for Windows\n\t\t\t\tInstances for information to help you run Windows-based instances on\n\t\t\tEC2.\nAmazon EC2 supports the processing, storage, and transmission \nof credit card data by a merchant or service provider, and has been \nvalidated as being compliant with Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard (DSS). \nFor more information about PCI DSS, including how to request a copy of the AWS PCI Compliance Package, \nsee PCI DSS Level 1.\n\nIf you are looking for technical guidance about Amazon EC2, try AWS re:Post.\nFor more information about cloud computing, see What is cloud computing?\nFeatures\nGet started\nRelated services\nAccess EC2\nPricing\n\n\n\n\nFeatures of Amazon EC2\nAmazon EC2 provides the following high-level features:\nVirtual servers.\nPreconfigured templates for your instances that package the components you\n\t\t\t\t\t\tneed for your server (including the operating system and additional\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoftware).\nVarious configurations of CPU, memory, storage, networking capacity, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgraphics hardware for your instances.\nSecure login information for your instances.

You can optionally connect these virtual networks to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyour own network.\nFor details about all of the features of Amazon EC2, see Amazon EC2 features. \nFor options to run your website on AWS, see Web Hosting.\n\n\n\n\nGet started with Amazon EC2\nThe following topics can help you get started with Amazon EC2.

You can find the Amazon EC2 commands in the AWS CLI Command Reference.\nA set of PowerShell modules that are built on the functionality exposed by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe AWS SDK for .NET.

To get started, see the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAWS Tools for Windows PowerShell User Guide. You can find the cmdlets for Amazon EC2, in the AWS Tools for PowerShell Cmdlet Reference.\nAmazon EC2 supports creating resources using AWS CloudFormation. You create a template, in JSON or YAML\n\t\t\t\t\t\tformat, that describes your AWS resources, and AWS CloudFormation provisions and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconfigures those resources for you. You can reuse your CloudFormation\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttemplates to provision the same resources multiple times, whether in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsame Region and account or in multiple Regions and accounts. For more\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinformation about supported resource types and properties for Amazon EC2, see\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEC2 resource type\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treference in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide.\nAmazon EC2 provides a Query API. These requests are HTTP or HTTPS requests that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuse the HTTP verbs GET or POST and a Query parameter named\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAction. For more information about the API actions for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAmazon EC2, see Actions in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAmazon EC2 API Reference.\nIf you prefer to build applications using language-specific APIs instead\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof submitting a request over HTTP or HTTPS, AWS provides libraries, sample\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcode, tutorials, and other resources for software developers. These\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlibraries provide basic functions that automate tasks such as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcryptographically signing your requests, retrying requests, and handling\n\t\t\t\t\t\terror responses, making it easier for you to get started.
